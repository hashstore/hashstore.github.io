## Explore packages with tricks

Let's say we have text with same mistake repeated multiple times, and we want to fix it in one go. Somebody suggessted to use `re.sub`.

```python
>>> dir()
['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 's', 'x']
```
